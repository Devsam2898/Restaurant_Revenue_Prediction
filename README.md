# Restaurant Revenue Prediction

This project aims to predict the revenue of a restaurant based on various factors such as location, cuisine, opening hours, and other relevant features. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques and a dataset containing historical information about restaurant revenue.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

Dataset Attributes:
1. ID - Restaurant ID
2. Name - Name of the Restaurant
3. Franchise - Restaurant has franchise or not
4. Category - specific type of category provided by restaurant
5. No_of_item - Different types of items provided by restaurant
6. Order_Placed - Order placed by customer to restaurant (in lacs)
7. Revenue - Total amount of income generated by the restaurant

The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, where the training set is used to train the prediction model, and the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset files, including the training and test data files.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This directory stores the trained prediction models.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Setup and Dependencies

To run the project code and notebooks, you need to ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and run the code cells.
4. Use the `src/` directory to modify or extend the source code as needed.
5. Store any additional datasets in the `data/` directory.
6. Run the prediction model on the test set and evaluate its performance.
7. Save the trained models in the `models/` directory for future use.
